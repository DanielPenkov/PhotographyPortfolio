        I was born in Bulgaria and after I graduated in Photography from The National Academy of Art in Sofia, I decided to move to Denmark. Currently I work as a freelance portrait & event photographer in Aalborg and NÃ¸rresundby.

        You can also buy some of my landscape photos printed, framed and ready to hang on your wall.

        I love capturing and creating beautiful stories and I believe the pictures speak for themselves. You can ask me anything on my Facebook page.
        Thanks for stopping by!
